## Introduction

TOIQ addresses the pressing challenges facing IoT device management, including identity verification, message authentication, firmware integrity, and device reputation. By utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technology, TOIQ provides a decentralized solution that enhances security, privacy, and trust in IoT networks.

## Abstract

The TOIQ project explores the application of blockchain technology for the registration and control of IoT devices. Through the development of a robust system comprising smart contracts, web interfaces, and device-platform interactions, TOIQ offers authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation for IoT device management.

## Concept

TOIQ is built upon four core concepts:

1. **Device Identity**: Devices are registered on the Ethereum blockchain without revealing private properties, using Merkle trees for identity management.
2. **Message Authentication**: Cryptographically signed messages are validated using blockchain, ensuring message integrity and non-repudiation.
3. **Firmware Hashing**: Verification of firmware integrity prevents unauthorized access and tampering with device functionality.
4. **Device Reputation**: Devices establish trust through a Web of Trust principle, accumulating signatures from reputable devices to enhance their trustworthiness.

## Architecture

TOIQ's architecture consists of three main components:

- **Entities**: Users and organizations interact with the system through web interfaces for device registration and management.
- **Devices**: IoT devices send cryptographically signed messages to the platform, ensuring secure communication.
- **IoT Platform**: The platform validates messages using blockchain technology, providing authentication and integrity checks for device interactions.
